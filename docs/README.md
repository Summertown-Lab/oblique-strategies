[Oblique Strategies](http://www.rtqe.net/ObliqueStrategies/index.html) is a cards method for improving creativity created by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt in the seventies to encourage lateral thinking (*i.e.* solving problems using indirect reasoning).

This project presents a strategies generator based on a JavaScript object of a predesigned random quote generator ([see repository](https://github.com/b2point0h/random-quote-generator)). On the other hand, the strategies have been forked from this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ptigas/oblique-strategies).

- Oblique Strategies Generator in Spanish (forthcoming).
